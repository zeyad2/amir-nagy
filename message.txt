Design a modern, student-friendly, and visually appealing mobile & web app UI/UX for Campus Eats – Revolutionising University Food Ordering. The design should feel vibrant, youthful, and easy to navigate, while maintaining professionalism for vendors and administrators. Use a fresh color palette (mix of warm and energetic colors like orange/yellow for food, balanced with cool tones like teal/blue for trust and readability, and neutral grays/whites for clean layouts). Apply modern styling: minimal clutter, rounded edges, soft shadows, smooth animations, and consistent iconography.
