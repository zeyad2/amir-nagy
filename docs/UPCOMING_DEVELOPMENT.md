## 📝 Notes for Claude Code

### When Implementing a Phase:
1. Read the requirements carefully
2. Check if backend API exists (see IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
3. Start with backend if needed, then frontend
4. Test each feature before moving on
5. Update documentation when complete
6. Mark phase as complete in IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

### Best Practices:
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI
- Use existing services (api.service.js, auth.service.js)
- Add error handling everywhere
- Make it mobile responsive
- Test on real data

### Getting Help:
- Check existing similar components for patterns
- Reference API documentation in `docs/api/`
- Look at completed phases for examples
- Test endpoints with Postman or curl first

---

**Remember:** Focus on completing MVP features (Phases 10-13) before moving to enhancements. The platform must be fully functional for students before adding analytics and advanced features.
